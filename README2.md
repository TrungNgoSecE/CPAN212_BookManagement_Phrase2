1. Project Overview
   A brief summary of your full-stack Book Management System, describing its purpose, technologies used (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB), and the key functions it provides.

2. Implemented Features
   A clear bullet list of features such as:
   User authentication (login + OTP verification)
   Role-based access control (Admin/User)
   CRUD operations for books
   Client-side + server-side validation
   Pagination, search, and filtering
   Email sending for OTP
   Secure JWT session management
   Full API integration between frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render)

3. Learning Outcomes
   Highlight the main concepts you learned:
   Building REST APIs with Express + MongoDB
   Implementing JWT authentication and MFA using email
   Applying RBAC to control route access
   Developing React components with routing and protected routes
   Handling API calls, errors, and state management
   Deploying full-stack applications (Render + Vercel)
   Using environment variables securely

4. Challenges Faced
   Keep it short and impactful:
   Debugging environment variable issues (.env not loading, DB connection errors)
   Fixing CORS and API communication between frontend and backend
   Handling asynchronous OTP flow and email delivery failures
   Deploying with Vite and managing correct API URLs
   Ensuring protected routes behave correctly for different roles
   Include 1–2 sentences about how you solved each (e.g., using middleware, logging errors, adjusting deployment configs).

5. Future Improvements
   A short and realistic list, such as:
   Add user registration & profile management
   Add book categories, image upload, and sorting enhancements
   Improve UI/UX with animations or Material UI
   Implement dark mode
   Add test automation (Jest, Postman test collection)
   Add analytics dashboard for admins
